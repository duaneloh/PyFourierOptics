##Diffraction tutorial
This will be based on Goodman's chapter 4.
- Rayleigh-Sommerfeld scalar diffraction
- Fresnel approximation for near-field diffraction 
- Fraunhofer approximation for far-field diffraction
- Image formation with phases
- Image formation without phases

##Fourier transforming property of thin lenses
